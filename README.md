# OpenStudyBuilder Accelerators

This repository contains **accelerators** for the [**OpenStudyBuilder**](https://www.openstudybuilder.com/) ecosystem.

Accelerators are practical, reusable assets designed to make it easier and faster to **set up, deploy, integrate, or experiment with OpenStudyBuilder** in different environments.

The repository may evolve over time to include different accelerators.

## Repository Structure

Each accelerator is organized in its own sub-folder. Please refer to the README files in the corresponding sub-folder for further information and instructions.

## Scope & Expectations

This repository:
- Focuses on **operational accelerators**, not core development
- May contain examples that are **not production-hardened**
- Is designed to be **adapted and extended** to your needs

For OpenStudyBuilder core development, documentation, and governance, see the main [OpenStudyBuilder repository](https://github.com/NovoNordisk-OpenSource/openstudybuilder-solution).
